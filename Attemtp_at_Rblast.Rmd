I'm not using rBlast because it returns ncbi identifiers rather than taxa and then I have to look all of those up manually anyway.
so in the end used ncbi-blast on a fasta of vibrio data
and parsed the text file output to get species names.

```{r}
library(rBLAST)
```


```{r}
bl <- blast(db=here("Blast","16SMicrobialDB", "16S_ribosomal_RNA"))
vib_seq <- readDNAStringSet(here("IntermediateData", "vibrios.fa")) # needs to be DNA since I'm working with DNA
```

```{r}
vib1_cl <- predict(bl, vib_seq, BLAST_args = "-perc_identity 99")
vib1_cl
```
