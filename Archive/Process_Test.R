## Inital attempt to explore drain log data.

## Libraries, etc
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

## Spawn Info
# `Date Spawned` = "D"
spawnInfo00 <- read_excel(here("HatcheryData", "2021 Spawn info.xlsx"), col_types = c("text", "date", "numeric"))

  

## Bring in Drain log data

drainLogRaw00 <- read_excel(here("HatcheryData", "2021 Drain Log Final_jacedit.xlsx"),
                            sheet = "raw drain day")
drainLogRaw01 <- drainLogRaw00 %>%
  mutate(datetime = ymd_hms(datetime))

## Lets start with just one cast. I like 21-38 a "best" batch.

spawn2138 <- spawnInfo00 %>% 
  filter(brood == "21-38")

drain2138 <- drainLogRaw01 %>%
  filter(brood == "21-38")

## The process of what I'd evenutally like a funciton to do.
## Track each open tank at each time-point and keep track of dead, swimming, and graduated larvae

## Notes: Can't handle systems other than 8 and 4
## 11 should be synonomous with 4 (refrigerator/settled)
## 28 with death, I think, but I think it could be considered graduated and wouldn't screw things up too much and would be easier to handle
